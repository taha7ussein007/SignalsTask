Practical Task must contain the following:
1- Draw “using plot function” your continuous periodic signal (for example,??=sin(??)).
a. Change its amplitude with any value.
b. Change its phase with any value.
c. Change its frequency with any value.
Using “Subplot function” to combine all in one figure like Fig.1.

2- Draw “using stem function” your discrete periodic signal (for example,?? = cos(??)).
a. Change its amplitude with any value.
b. Change its phase with any value.
c. Change its frequency with any value.
Using “Subplot function” to combine all in one figure like Fig.2.

3- Prove that the value of the following summations (using MATLAB):
a. S (0.5)?? = 2
8
??=0
b. S (2)?? = 63
5
??=0
4- Prove that the value of the following Integration (using MATLAB):
? ????. ????
0
-8 = 1
5- Prove that the value of the following Differentiation (using MATLAB):
?? = ??3
????
????
= 3??2
6- Find the value of Convolution (y[n]) of the following discrete signal (using MATLAB) and
by your hand (in external Paper):
h[??] = {2 , 1 , 3}
??[??] = {3 , 2 , 1}
7- Find the Z-Transform of any signal such as:
??[??] = (1/4)??
Note that z-transform in MATLAB is using (Unilateral z-transform)
8- Find the Fourier Transform of any signal and plot it in both time-domain and complex
frequency-domain.
